# ***What and Why is Hacking***

Opinions: **breaking any process, any misconfiguration or loopholes to use for benefits is hacking**

Opinions: **unauthorized access to entity using loopholes is hacking**

##  Hasan Opinions: 


> 1.Applying ingenuity to create clever results.

> 2.Why I am doing hacking because I will be the going to become the ones who understand the internet like the attackers, I saw this system for what is was a network worth protecting.

>  3.Hacking is often thought of in negative terms, like the image of someone in a basement wearing a black hoodie typing on a computer, and trying to hack into the NSA. But this stereotype is wrong. Hacking can be done in different ways from mischievous individuals seeking attention to practical purposes like testing security or analyzing vulnerabilities. The main goal of hacking is to find weaknesses and try to exploit them.

- Example: building is built and need to check how long the build last, check form general check team they can do anything to test the building quality like break with hammer, using acid anything.
-  In CyberSecurity company hired hacker to break the entity because they know if this hired hacker can do then outsider hacker can also do.
-  The best way to prevent hacking is to perform hacking

#   ***_Different NAME from REDTEAM Side:_***

**Crackers** : It’s the one who utilizes the unauthorized access to damage the entitle.

**Script Kidde** : They don’t have the in-depend knowledge of script, like using someone else tool to perform hacking is a part of script kidding. These individuals use pre-written scripts or tools to hack into systems, often without understanding how they work.  including ME:(
