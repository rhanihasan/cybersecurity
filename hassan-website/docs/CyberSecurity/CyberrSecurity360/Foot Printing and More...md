- Using Wappalyzer for basic passive foot printing, enumeration and information gathering. 

  

Sometimes the Wappalyzer didnâ€™t give full information or because of cache its show previews or stored information 

  

To remove the Cache. 

  

  

![Before_wappalzer_cache_is _not _cleared](./cybersecurity_img/Before_wappalzer_cache_is%20_not%20_cleared.png)  

  

> Navigate to **Wappalyzer setting** >>

:::note 

Target is monash.edu 

::: 

  

``` 

site:*.*.monash.edu ext:yml 

``` 

  

- Means site : all sub domains . all sub domains . root domains . edu 

- What is yml ?

![targets.monashsearchreults](./cybersecurity_img/Targets/monash/monashsearchreults.png) 

  

From the URL it seems that they are using services which are Gitlab and GitHub.

![targets.monashsearchreultsopenedrepository](./cybersecurity_img/Targets/monash/monashsearchreultsopenedrepository.png) 

  

Checked the env file. 

  

![target.monashsearchreultsopenedrepositoryenvcheck](./cybersecurity_img/Targets/monash/monashsearchreultsopenedrepositoryenvcheck.png) 

  

***Why it didn't ask for GitHub/GitLab Login Credentials ?*** 

  

- To that Navigate to monash index.html file 

	 ![target.monashsearchreultsopenedrepositoryindexhtmlcheck](./cybersecurity_img/Targets/monash/monashsearchreultsopenedrepositoryindexhtmlcheck.png) 

    ![target.monashsearchreultsopenedrepositoryindexhtmlauthasked](./cybersecurity_img/Targets/monash/monashsearchreultsopenedrepositoryindexhtmlauthasked.png) 

:::note
- As the above results show there is authentication Functions from index.html knowing it is in GitLab, with enumeration break the CIA! of monash.edu 
:::
    
:::success
This is Basic Bypass Authentication of monash.edu
