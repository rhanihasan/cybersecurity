#  Basic Enum, Info Gathering & Vulnerability Assessment

  

## **What & Why Information Gathering**

  

- Information Gathering means collecting the information for whatever means necessary.

- It is a crucial phase in Hacking... Information helps the tester to know about the entities and fascilable planning to test the security.

- The information mostly gathers form websites for the entities

## **_Assets Discovery_**

  

### **_What Is Assets Discovery ?_**

  

As a person will be the target then collect information of target with the people the target meet. The victim asset means what is has an assets.

  

It makes the attack path increased.

  

## **Enumeration**

  

- After validation when the information is dug up is called enumerations

  

### **Domain**

  

A domain name is a unique address for a website that can be acquired. Usually, it consists of a website name and a domain name extension.

  

### **Types of Domain**

  

- Horizontal Domain

- Vertical Domain

### **Horizontal Enumeration**

  

During a security assessment, our main aim is to find and list all the main websites owned by a single entity.

  

**Crunchbase**

### **_Vertical Enumeration_**

Vertical enumeration, or vertical domain correlation, is the process of discovering and connecting related websites that belong to the same organization or entity.

Vertical Enumeration can be performed with the help of below methods. Which is

## Passive Information gathering.

Passive information gathering is based on **other with whatever is asked**

:::note 
Don’t trust the passive information because it is available to others for some logical reasons.

### **What is subdomain enumeration?**

Subdomain enumeration is a crucial step in understanding the structure of a website. It involves finding and identifying smaller sections within a larger website. To put it simply, it's like exploring different sections or pages that are part of a main website. **Subdomain Enumeration** is a process of finding sub-domains associated to the root domain. According to <code>RFC 1034</code>, "a domain is a subdomain of another domain if it is contained within that domain".

### **FQND**

- A Fully Qualified Domain Name (**FQDN**) is the complete domain name for a specific computer, or host, on the internet.

- An FQDN looks like this: -

>myhost.example.com. **---->** Fully Qualified Domain Name
>
>myhost **---->** is the host located within the domain example.com (subdomain)

## **_Information gathering of Subdomains._**

**whois lookup**: help to gather the information based on **domain**.

How the **whois** get the information of Domian because when the target Regester with domain vendors it must provide some information/details to authority. And they will available this information public as they use this method of advertisement unless and until buy the premium subscription

Register **whois** server is where the whois get the information of domain.

_Syntax: whois_

_Cmd_:

```
#whois <name><.in><.com><.etc>
```

|The premium subscription: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY         |The premium non-subscription gets the information marketing also: GoDaddy sell domain|

-  _Use various information from this **Updated Date** and try to buy before the original target did._

|This is Known as Security Plan.|This is not a Security Plan.|

**_Try to Find the information which can be reuse for further Gathering._**

### **_Censys Search_**:

Censys Search is a search engine that helps you find and understand information about devices and networks connected to the internet, revealing security issues and other important details.

**Home page:** [**https://search.censys.io/**](https://search.censys.io/)

![Census-home-page](./cybersecurity_img/Basic%20Enum%2C%20Info%20Gathering%20%26%20Vulnerability%20Assessment/censyshomepage.png)


:::note
sometimes censys found and sometimes it's doesn't

- **_Try to Explore more like this :_**

 **_this indicate that the target use vpn for palo alto vendous which is global protect. Got the Algorithum Details and try to decrepted ._**

    ![censys-search-pa](./cybersecurity_img/Basic%20Enum%2C%20Info%20Gathering%20%26%20Vulnerability%20Assessment/censys-search-pa.png)

- ***How does censys know get these details*** ? 
	
	- ***Using the certificate.***

### **_RapidDNS:_**

**Home: https://rapiddns.io/**

- It Will Give Information about DNS Records of targets

### **_Crt sh_**

- It searches through the certificate fingerprint and domain name

![cet-sh-results](./cybersecurity_img/Basic%20Enum%2C%20Info%20Gathering%20%26%20Vulnerability%20Assessment/crtsh-results.png)

- These three certs might be belonged to netplace 
- The operator of the certificate is google and Cloudflare
